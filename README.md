STAR CITIZEN — Onyx Security Facility Compendium
A multi‑system reference atlas for bunker, security, and enforcement sites across the ‘verse.

Overview:
This project is a comprehensive, long‑term effort to map, document, and standardize information on security facilities throughout Star Citizen. It begins with the full catalog of Stanton’s Onyx facilities and will expand to include Pyro, Nyx, Terra, and every future star system as they are released.

Project Goal:
To provide players, orgs, explorers, and mission runners with a single‑source, unified reference for Star Citizen’s security facilities — a clear, accurate, and future‑proof compendium designed for navigation, planning, and operations.

Current Coverage:
Stanton System
	Full coordinate mapping for all known Onyx security facilities.
	Standardized designation schema.
	Terrain and approach notes.
	Jurisdiction breakdowns.
	Clean, structured formatting for easy reference and tool integration.

This dataset represents one of the most complete and accurate mappings of Stanton’s security network available to the community.

Project Scope & Expansion:
This compendium is designed from the ground up to be modular and expandable. As CIG releases new systems, this repository will grow to include:
	Pyro — Security sites, enforcement outposts, and hostile‑zone facilities.
	Nyx — Abandoned stations, security remnants, and active patrol sites.
	Terra — Metropolitan security complexes and high‑traffic enforcement hubs.
	Future systems — Added as they enter the Persistent Universe.

Each system will receive:
	A dedicated folder.
	A standardized facility index.
	Coordinates, designations, and terrain notes.
	Cross‑system naming consistency.

This ensures the compendium remains a living, evolving atlas of the Star Citizen universe. This compendium is updated as new systems release and as time allows. Accuracy and clarity are the priority; updates follow the pace of the game and the availability of reliable data.

Purpose:
This project exists to support the following:
	Explorers seeking reliable navigation data.
	Org leaders building training or mission protocols.
	SAR teams needing precise coordinates.
	FPS players running bunker missions.
	Tool developers integrating location data.
	Lore‑minded players who appreciate structured worldbuilding.

All data is provided freely for community use.
