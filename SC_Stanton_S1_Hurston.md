A note from the Author...

"After months of mapping, cross‑checking, and compiling, I have created a complete atlas of all 120 Onyx facilities in the Stanton system — including coordinates, designations, terrain notes, and jurisdiction breakdowns. To my knowledge, this is the most comprehensive bunker reference chart in existence, and I am sharing it freely with the Star Citizen community. From one explorer to another."
